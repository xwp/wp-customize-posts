## Description ##

*This is a feature plugin intended to implement [#34923](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34923): Introduce basic content authorship in the Customize.*

The goal for this plugin is to be able to expose the editing of posts and pages in the Customizer, allowing you to edit post data and postmeta for any number of posts, and preview the changes before saving them for others to see. This plugin was birthed out of the Widget Customizer feature-as-plugin project which was merged into WordPress Core: as widgets (in 3.9) and nav menus (4.3) can now be managed in the Customizer, so too should posts and pages be editable in the Customizer as well.

Did you know that **changing the featured image actually makes the change live even before you save the post**? This is very surprising/unexpected behavior. The only way to truly preview a change to a featured image is to use something like Customize Posts.

Likewise, did you know that **changing a page template cannot be previewed from the post editor?** When you change the selected page template, the change will not show up when you preview the page (see [#11049](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11049)). However, in Customize Posts you *can* preview changes to the page template just by changing the dropdown selection, and then you can see what your page would look like with the new template after the preview refreshes.

Most other changes to metaboxes containing data that gets saved to custom fields (postmeta) also get written when clicking the Preview button. The Customize Posts plugin provides a framework to edit postmeta in the Customizer with a live preview of the changes. (Fixing this underlying issue of incorrectly persisting postmeta when doing a preview is captured in [#20299](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20299).)

As much as possible, the previewing of changes in Customize Posts utilizes the [selective refresh](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/16/selective-refresh-in-the-customizer/) capabilities introduced in WordPress 4.5. Not only does this mean it is faster to preview changes to posts and postmeta, but it also allows you to shift-click on an element to focus on the corresponding control in the Customizer pane. For example you can shift-click on the post title in the preview to focus on the post title control's input field, or shift-click on a featured image to focus on the control's button to open the media library.

**Development of this plugin is done [on GitHub](https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts). Pull requests welcome. Please see [issues](https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues) reported there before going to the [plugin forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customize-posts).**

(This **Customize Posts** plugin is not to be confused with 10up's [**Post Customizer**](https://github.com/10up/Post-Customizer).)

[2016-03-04] Demo featuring the WP visual rich text editor (TinyMCE), including the insertion of images from the media library. Post content can be edited in the Customizer and previewed in multiple contexts. For example, this allows you to preview how a Read More tag will appear when the post appears on a post list page, and you can navigate to the single post to continue previewing subsequent paragraphs. You can expand the editor into a full-screen mode to focus on writing and then quickly preview the changes on the site by toggling the editor. You can make changes to as many posts as you want, but none of the changes will go live until you hit Save & Publish: everything is previewed so there is no “save and surprise”.

[2016-03-03] Demonstration of integration with [Customize Setting Validation](https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-setting-validation) ([#34893](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34893)) to gracefully handle failures to save due to post locking and concurrent user editing:

[2016-03-01] Demonstration of hooking into edit post links so that they actually work in the Customizer and expand the section to edit the given post (as opposed to the link doing nothing at all when clicked), as well as shift-clicking on the title and content (needs better discovery UI, see [#27403](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27403)):

## Changelog ##

### 0.5.0 - 2016-04-27 ###

* Featured image control, with sync from Customizer post preview back to post edit screen. Changes to the featured image can now be previewed, where normally this is not possible in WordPress. Improved featured image selection on edit post screen to not update featured image in place, instead waiting until the post is Saved until updating the featured image postmeta. The featured image can be set from the post edit screen and then previewed in the Customizer via the post Preview Changes button: the featured image can be further changed in the Customizer post preview, with changes synced back to the post edit screen when the Customizer post preview is exited. (Issue #57, PR #102)
* Author control and preview, with sync from Customizer post preview back to post edit screen (Issue #62, PRs #89 #92)
* Excerpt control and preview, with sync from Customizer post preview back to post edit screen (Issue #60, PR #91)
* Comment status control and preview, with sync from Customizer post preview back to post edit screen (Issues #61, PR #100)
* Ping status control and preview, with sync from Customizer post preview back to post edit screen (Issue #64, PR #100)
* Improve PHPUnit test coverage to 98%.
* Note: Selective refresh support was specifically tested with Twenty Fifteen and Twenty Sixteen. See #103 for a way for themes to configure how they represent the various post fields in template parts.

Fixed:

* Improve editor styles in mobile and in fullscreen mode. (Issue #45, PR #107)
* Modals, toolbars, and tooltips and are no longer hidden (Issue #80, PRs #81, #101).
* Improve compatibility with Customize Widgets Plus (PR #83). See also https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-widgets-plus/pull/46 for a fix in the Customizer post preview.
* Export post/postmeta settings during selective refresh requests so that new posts added will appear in the panel, such as when adding the number of posts to show in the Recent Posts widget. (Issue #97, PR #99)
* Improve compatibility with Customize Snapshots (PR #95)
