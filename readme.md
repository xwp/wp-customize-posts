## Description ##

*This is a feature plugin intended to implement [#34923](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34923): Introduce basic content authorship in the Customizer.*

The goal for this plugin is to be able to expose the editing of posts and pages in the Customizer, allowing you to edit post data and postmeta for any number of posts, and preview the changes before saving them for others to see. This plugin was birthed out of the Widget Customizer feature-as-plugin project which was merged into WordPress Core: as widgets (in 3.9) and nav menus (4.3) can now be managed in the Customizer, so too should posts and pages be editable in the Customizer as well.

Did you know that **changing the featured image actually makes the change live even before you save the post**? This is very surprising/unexpected behavior. The only way to truly preview a change to a featured image is to use something like Customize Posts.

Likewise, did you know that **changing a page template cannot be previewed from the post editor?** When you change the selected page template, the change will not show up when you preview the page (see [#11049](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11049)). However, in Customize Posts you *can* preview changes to the page template just by changing the dropdown selection, and then you can see what your page would look like with the new template after the preview refreshes.

Most other changes to metaboxes containing data that gets saved to custom fields (postmeta) also get written when clicking the Preview button. The Customize Posts plugin provides a framework to edit postmeta in the Customizer with a live preview of the changes. (Fixing this underlying issue of incorrectly persisting postmeta when doing a preview is captured in [#20299](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20299).)

As much as possible, the previewing of changes in Customize Posts utilizes the [selective refresh](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/16/selective-refresh-in-the-customizer/) capabilities introduced in WordPress 4.5. Not only does this mean it is faster to preview changes to posts and postmeta, but it also allows you to shift-click on an element to focus on the corresponding control in the Customizer pane. For example you can shift-click on the post title in the preview to focus on the post title control's input field, or shift-click on a featured image to focus on the control's button to open the media library.

**Development of this plugin is done [on GitHub](https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts). Pull requests welcome. Please see [issues](https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues) reported there before going to the [plugin forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customize-posts).**

(This **Customize Posts** plugin is not to be confused with 10up's [**Post Customizer**](https://github.com/10up/Post-Customizer).)

[2016-03-04] Demo featuring the WP visual rich text editor (TinyMCE), including the insertion of images from the media library. Post content can be edited in the Customizer and previewed in multiple contexts. For example, this allows you to preview how a Read More tag will appear when the post appears on a post list page, and you can navigate to the single post to continue previewing subsequent paragraphs. You can expand the editor into a full-screen mode to focus on writing and then quickly preview the changes on the site by toggling the editor. You can make changes to as many posts as you want, but none of the changes will go live until you hit Save & Publish: everything is previewed so there is no “save and surprise”.

* Allow page/post stubs created via nav menus in 4.7-alpha to also be edited like any other page. See <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/253" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/253" data-id="176089785">#253</a> and PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/287" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-id="177968990" title="Insert full posts instead of stubs via nav menus">#287</a>.
* For nav menu items linking to a post/page, add a edit button that appears in the nav menu item control next to the original link. Clicking edit will expand the section for that post/page, and collapsing the section will return focus to the button in the nav menu item control. See <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/147" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/147" data-id="156856956">#147</a> and PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/288" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/288" data-id="178214146">#288</a>.
* Sync post/page changes to available nav menu items and nav menu item controls, ensuring titles are consistent in available item lists and in the nav menu item control's title, label placeholder, and original link, and in the nav menu item setting's <code>original_title</code> property. If a nav menu item lacks its own <code>title</code> and inherits from <code>original_title</code>, post/page changes will now trigger nav menu selective refresh updates. See <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/156" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-id="157966860" title="Ensure that newly-added posts/pages appear among list of available nav menu items">#156</a> and PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/288" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/288" data-id="178214146">#288</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/289" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/289" data-id="178254750">#289</a>.

* Add previewing of title changes for pages listed by <code>wp_list_pages()</code>. PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/256" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/256" data-id="176196258">#256</a>.
* Implement support for all of the <code>WP_Query</code> query vars, including post meta queries, ensuring results have posts' customized state applied as expected. This is a big improvement to ensure customized posts and postmeta will appear the same before or after saving the customized state. Previously, previewing <code>WP_Query</code> results was very limited and often not accurate. As part of this, <code>get_posts()</code> and any queries made with <code>suppress_filters</code> on will be overridden to force filters to apply. See <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/246" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/246" data-id="174935332">#246</a> and PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/248" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/248" data-id="175036035">#248</a>.
* Add support to <code>WP_Customize_Postmeta_Setting</code> for representing non-single postmeta. Such settings are instantiated with a true <code>single</code> arg and they require an array value. The <code>customize_sanitize_{$setting_id}</code> filter will apply to each array item separately, as will the <code>sanitize_meta()</code> call. PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/248" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/248" data-id="175036035">#248</a>.
* Ensure that static front page constructs get registered even without any pages yet created. Add active callback to the static front page section so that it will appear as soon as a published page exists (either via adding a new page from the Pages panel or via a nav menu item page stub in WP 4.7-alpha). See <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/252" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/252" data-id="176088241">#252</a> and PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/254" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/254" data-id="176191968">#254</a>.
* Refactor editor control to be reusable for not just post content but also custom fields (postmeta). See PRs <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/216" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/216" data-id="170141016">#216</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/269" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/269" data-id="177433639">#269</a>.
* Ensure that the results of <code>get_pages()</code> has the customized state applied. This enables support for <code>wp_dropdown_pages()</code> (and thus the post parent control). See <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/241" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/241" data-id="174864969">#241</a> and PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/250" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/250" data-id="175667734">#250</a>.
* Prevent the same page from being selected as both the page for posts and the page on front. PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/270" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/270" data-id="177513674">#270</a>.
* Improve support for page for posts by hiding page template and content since not displayed. Show notice that the page for posts is being edited. See <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/228" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/228" data-id="172810805">#228</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/277" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/277" data-id="177631373">#277</a> and PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/278" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/278" data-id="177632576">#278</a>.
* Allow <code>posts</code> component to be filtered out to be disabled like other components (<code>widgets</code> and <code>nav_menus</code>). See <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/132" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/132" data-id="153294531">#132</a> with PRs <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/219" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/219" data-id="171576042">#219</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/258" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/258" data-id="176218976">#258</a>.
* Disable edit-post-links module in customize-direct-manipulation plugin so that edit links in the preview will continue to work in Customize Posts. PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/234" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/234" data-id="174110828">#234</a>.

See <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/105" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/105" data-id="150835037">#105</a> and PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/236" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/236" data-id="174199695">#236</a>.
* Use non-minified scripts and styles if plugin installed via git (submodule), eliminating the need to add <code>SCRIPT_DEBUG</code> or do a build. PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/249" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/249" data-id="175164833">#249</a>.

### [0.7.0] - 2016-08-06 ###
Added:

 * Introduce Select2 dropdown in a post type's panel for searching for any post to load, even if it is not shown in the preview. Selecting a post adds its section to the Customizer and expands it while also navigating to the post's URL in the preview. Trashed posts are also listed, and selecting a trashed post will load its post data into the Customizer in its untrashed state (restoring its original status and slug) so that upon save it will be be untrashed. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/196" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/196" data-id="164758731">#196</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/199" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/199" data-id="167144506">#199</a>)
 * Add control for post <em>date</em>, including synchronization with publish/future status for when date is in future. Control includes timezone information and countdown for when schedule publish will happen. Also includes reset link to leave the date empty so that it will default to the current date/time when it is published.

 * Allow post field control labels to be defined in <code>register_post_type()</code> so that the names can be repurposed to be appropriate to the custom post type. (<a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/195" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/195" data-id="163751896">#195</a>)

### 0.6.0 - 2016-06-02 ###
Added:

 * Add the ability to create new posts and pages in the Customizer. Created posts get <code>auto-draft</code> status in the DB so they will be garbage-collected if the Customizer is never saved. A new view link appears in the post section allowing a newly-created post to be navigated to easily without having to find the created post linked to in the preview. (Issues <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/48" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/48" data-id="139489948">#48</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/50" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/50" data-id="139490828">#50</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/134" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-id="154290445" title="Post Creation">#134</a>)
 * Add post status control and preview, with <code>trash</code> status support (Issues <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/40" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-id="138757986" title="Add post status dropdown selection control and preview">#40</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/137" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-id="154582644" title="Delete a post whilst in the Customizer">#137</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/152" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/152" data-id="157317131">#152</a>)
 * Add support for setting validation in WordPress 4.6-alpha, showing notifications if attempting to save when a post is locked or a conflicting update was previously made. (Issue <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/142" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/142" data-id="156058078">#142</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/150" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/150" data-id="156916244">#150</a>)
 * Add the ability to vertically resize the post editor (Issue <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/136" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/136" data-id="154541791">#136</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/149" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/149" data-id="156898366">#149</a>)
 * Add post slug control, wherein changes do not cause the preview to refresh by default since there is nothing to see (Issue <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/63" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/63" data-id="140028525">#63</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/148" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/148" data-id="156877309">#148</a>)
 * Posts data as saved will now be synced back into the Customizer interface, ensuring that if a post slug gets the infamous <code>-2</code> added, you’ll see that in the Control. Likewise, if a <code>wp_insert_post_data</code> filter or <code>content_save_pre</code> changes your data in some way, these will be shown in the post’s Customizer controls upon saving.
 * Add extendable theme &amp; plugin compatibility classes that can configure partial rendering. All Core themes &amp; Jetpack are currently supported. (Issues <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/82" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/82" data-id="145302561">#82</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/103" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/103" data-id="150771094">#103</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/123" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/123" data-id="151805533">#123</a>)
 * Use <code>plugins_url()</code> for each asset URL so that the plugin can be installed as a submodule without <code>SCRIPT_DEBUG</code> (Issue <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/133" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/133" data-id="154007394">#133</a>)

Fixed:

 * Add all postmeta settings for registered types not just the ones actually referenced (Issues <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/141" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/141" data-id="155671511">#141</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/145" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/145" data-id="156801928">#145</a>)
 * Export all registered post types to client, but only register panels if <code>show_in_customizer</code> (PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/130" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/130" data-id="152866156">#130</a>)
 * Ensure that control pane expand button is visible when editor is open and the Customizer pane is collapsed (Issue <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/44" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/44" data-id="139484076">#44</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/126" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/126" data-id="152710123">#126</a>)
 * Improve compatibility with the Customize Snapshots plugin.
 * Improve compatibility with the WP REST API plugin.
 * Supply a default <code>(no title)</code> placeholder to the post title control for new posts.
 * Filter post and page links in the Customizer to return the preview URL.

### 0.5.0 - 2016-04-27 ###
Added:

* Support for postmeta, including a framework for registering postmeta types. (Issues #1, PR #89)
* Page template control and preview, with sync from Customizer post preview back to post edit screen. (Issue #85, PR #89)
* Featured image control, with sync from Customizer post preview back to post edit screen. Changes to the featured image can now be previewed, where normally this is not possible in WordPress. Improved featured image selection on edit post screen to not update featured image in place, instead waiting until the post is Saved until updating the featured image postmeta. The featured image can be set from the post edit screen and then previewed in the Customizer via the post Preview Changes button: the featured image can be further changed in the Customizer post preview, with changes synced back to the post edit screen when the Customizer post preview is exited. (Issue #57, PR #102)
* Author control and preview, with sync from Customizer post preview back to post edit screen (Issue #62, PRs #89 #92)
* Excerpt control and preview, with sync from Customizer post preview back to post edit screen (Issue #60, PR #91)
* Comment status control and preview, with sync from Customizer post preview back to post edit screen (Issues #61, PR #100)
* Ping status control and preview, with sync from Customizer post preview back to post edit screen (Issue #64, PR #100)
* Improve PHPUnit test coverage to 98%.
* Note: Selective refresh support was specifically tested with Twenty Fifteen and Twenty Sixteen. See #103 for a way for themes to configure how they represent the various post fields in template parts.

Fixed:

* Improve editor styles in mobile and in fullscreen mode. (Issue #45, PR #107)
* Modals, toolbars, and tooltips and are no longer hidden (Issue #80, PRs #81, #101).
* Improve compatibility with Customize Widgets Plus (PR #83). See also https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-widgets-plus/pull/46 for a fix in the Customizer post preview.
* Export post/postmeta settings during selective refresh requests so that new posts added will appear in the panel, such as when adding the number of posts to show in the Recent Posts widget. (Issue #97, PR #99)
* Improve compatibility with Customize Snapshots (PR #95)
